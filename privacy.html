      <strong>Privacy at a glance:</strong><br />
      OhmniView uses your device&rsquo;s camera/album solely for on-device processing.
      Camera/photo images are <strong>not uploaded</strong>, <strong>not shared</strong>, and <strong>not stored on our servers</strong>.
      Any results are saved locally only if you explicitly choose to do so.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Camera/Photo data (on-device only):</strong><br />
      OhmniView accesses the device camera/album to capture images or live frames that are processed
      <em>entirely on your device</em> to generate results for the app&rsquo;s functionality.
      These camera/photo images are not demonstrated, transmitted, uploaded, or stored by us.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Derived results (optional local storage):</strong><br />
      OhmniView may generate derived data (such as processed outputs or results) from camera/photo input.
      These results are saved <strong>only if you explicitly choose to save them</strong>.
      Saved results remain stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to us.
    </p>

    <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong><br />
      OhmniView does not collect personal information such as name, email address, phone number,
      precise location, contacts, or identifiers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide the core functionality of OhmniView using on-device camera/photo processing.</li>
      <li>To generate results requested by the user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      OhmniView does not share data with third parties.
      Camera/Photo images and derived results are processed locally and are not transmitted off the device.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      OhmniView does not retain camera/photo images.
      Any derived results saved by the user are stored locally on the device and can be deleted by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deleting the saved results within the app (if applicable), or</li>
      <li>Uninstalling the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      OhmniView does <strong>not</strong> use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs,
      crash reporting tools, or tracking services.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>OhmniView requests the following permission:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera</strong> : required to capture images for on-device processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Photos</strong> : required to import images for on-device processing.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Because all camera/photo processing occurs locally on your device and no data is uploaded to external servers,
      exposure risk is minimized. We rely on the device&rsquo;s operating system security mechanisms to protect locally stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      OhmniView does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      The app processes camera data locally and does not transmit or store personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
